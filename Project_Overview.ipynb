    "## Description of Application\n",
    "> The application provides a way for League of Legends players to interface easily with the RIOT-Games API to utilize features and pull information that's usually not available or easily accessable to most players in-game. When ran, it allows for searching usernames or champion names to pull up information about the player or champion. If you search for a summoner, you'd see their level, their ID, and their name. If you search for a champion, you'll be able to see an exerpt of their lore, their title, and name as well as optionally choose to see a list of the champions abilities with descriptions, cooldowns, and ability costs. Optionally, you can also view people's mastery ranks to see what characters they play most often and when they last played them.\n",
